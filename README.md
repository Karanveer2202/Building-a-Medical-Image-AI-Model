## Building a Medical Image AI Model
### In this project, I followed a tutorial which can be found over here.[https://github.com/adleberg/medical-ai]

This process had five steps:

1. **Defining a problem**: what do we want our model to look for? For this we'll need to think of pathology we might find in a chest x-ray.
2. **Data preparation**: we'll talk about how to manipulate our data in a way the classification model can understand.
3. **Training a model**: we'll use a technology called [TensorFlow](
https://wwww.tensorflow.org) to create our model.
4. **Evaluating model performace**: we'll talk about some important considerations when creating a model like this.
5. **Deployment**: we'll send our model to a website where we can then test it in the wild and send to others.
